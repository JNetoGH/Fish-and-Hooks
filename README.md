# Fish and Hooks
This wifi-rod branch is the one reliable to get the wi-fi rod controller support, as we plan to develop the game anf redlease it in game stores, the support to this alternative controller may be set aside on the other branches, in this branch you can always seek to a compatible version.

You can get a working build with support to the wi-fi rod controller on this release:

https://github.com/JNetoGH/Fish-and-Hooks/releases/tag/v0.1.7

And a working version of the required Arduino's firmware in this repo:

## How to Set the Wi-fi Rod Up

- Turn the Arduino on.
- Connect to the "JNeto Arduino" wi-fi network, the pass is "jnetolindo".
- Open the game application.
- It will try to connect automatically, and the Arduino's back blue light should turn on.
- While connected to the Arduino, you can also try to connect via a browser the local network to the Arduino's local address (http://192.168.4.1) it will display a web page with the sensor's information.
